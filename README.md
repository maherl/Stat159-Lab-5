Task 1: basically User A created a new repository and User B cloned the existing repository to local. For every step of person made locally, each ppl should git pull in order to sync and then modify or create new files and then push everything local to origin master.

task2:
We have a conflict on task 2 when we are modifying the same file File2.txt. We resolve the conflict by first git pull and then push our changes to the file, since in this case we first have the change of the other user and then we modify it and push, and hence resolve the conflict.

Task 3: We donâ€™t have a conflict in task 3. File 1 was first modified by User A in the master branch, and then by User B in the task3B branch, and last modified by User B in the master branch.

Task 4
Both the users are on different branches and editing different files, so there are no conflicts.

Task 5
Even though people are working on different branches, they are editing the same file, so once one user pushes, the other one needs to pull before also pushing.
